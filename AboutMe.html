									</div>
							        <p>Change has been the constant thread throughout my career. It's hard to imagine an industry that has
							        been through more change in the last 25 years than Media and Entertainment. As I look back across my 
							        career, I can clearly see not only the changes that were happening around me, but also the ones I was directly involved in creating.</p>
							
							        <p>My passion for problem-solving, disrupting the status quo, and experimenting with new ideas has been at the heart of everything I’ve done. 
							        In my early days at NBCU, I championed shareable content on YouTube and MySpace before it was mainstream, 
							        launched a video podcast before podcasts were cool, and helped develop digital, tapeless production workflows.

								  <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Leading Innovation</h3>
								</div>
							        <p>Later, I co-founded Media Labs — NBCUniversal’s internal innovation team tasked with keeping the business ahead of the technology curve. 
							        I presented at leadership offsites, town halls, and industry events around the world, demonstrating cutting-edge technology, 
							        building exciting prototypes, and developing early-stage products.</p>
							
							        <p>One of my proudest moments was submitting a patent for an autonomous camera control system that I developed with colleagues at NEP. 
							        I'm proud to call myself an inventor and even more proud of the collaborative spirit that made it happen.</p>
								<p>This passion for innovation has been with me my whole life, and through my <a href ="Innovation.html">innovation coaching programme </a> I now
								use this experience to help others trying to suceed in innovation roles.</p>

										</div>
							        <p>My career has given me the opportunity to meet some incredible people, at all levels, in businesses around the world. 
							        I’ve seen first-hand how different types of people have different attitudes towards change, and how their mindset drives their actions.</p>
							
							        <p>I’ve watched people attempt to deny change even as it was crashing down around them and others fail to land the changes they were driving 
							        because they hadn’t been able to take their people on the journey. Time and time again, I’ve seen that change brings both challenges and opportunities.</p>
								
								<p>Problem-solving has always been at the heart of my work whether it was products, projects, or people. 
							        I’ve spent years untangling complex, messy systems and breaking them down into clear, purposeful solutions. 
							        The more I did this, the more I realised that the most fascinating, rewarding challenges weren’t technical — they were human.</p>

										  <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Why Coaching</h3>
										</div>
							
							        <p>Over time, I found myself gravitating towards the people side of change: how individuals respond to uncertainty, what motivates them, and 
							        how teams can move forward even when things feel unclear. I became the person colleagues turned to when things got difficult — not because I had all the answers, 
							        but because I could help them find clarity, confidence, and direction.</p>
							
							        <p>That shift in focus is what led me to coaching.</p>
							
							        <p>Today, I work <a href='OneToOneCoaching.html'>one to one</a> with leaders and with <a href='TeamCoaching.html'>teams</a> who are navigating growth, change, or new challenges. I help them unlock their potential by simplifying complexity, building trust quickly, 
							        and finding the best path forward, one that’s aligned with both their goals and values. I also offer a special service to those leaders working in innovation focussed roles via my <a href="Innovation.html">
								innovation coaching programme</a>.</p>
							
							        <p>Whether you’re scaling a team, stepping into a new role,feeling stuck, or trying to change the world, my job is to help you move forward.</p>
