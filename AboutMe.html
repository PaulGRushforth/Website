									<p>Change has been the constant thread throughout my career. It's hard to imagine an industry that has
									been through more change in the last 25 years than Media and Entertainment.  As I look back across my 
									career, I can claerly see not only the changes that happening around me, but also the ones I was invovled
									in creating.   My passion for problem solving, disrupting the status quo and experimenting with new things
									has been at the heart of everything I have done! 
									In my early days at NBCU, I championed sharable content on youtube and myspace before it; launched a video
									podcast way before it was cool; developed digital, tapeless production workflows.
									Later I would co-found Media Labs, the internal innovation team tasked with keeping the business ahead of the
									technology curve. I presented at leadership offsites, town halls and industry events around the world, demonstrating
									cutting edge technology and building exciting prototypes and early stage products.  I'm also proud to call myself 
									an "inventor" with a patent pending for an autonomous camera control system that I developed with colleagues at NEP.</br>
									My career has also given me the opportunity it meet some incredible people, at all levels, in businesses around the world. 
									I have seen first hand how different types of people have different attitudes towards change, and how their attitudes
									drive their actions. I have watch people attempt to deny change even as it is crashing down around them, and others 
									failing to land the changes that they are driving, becuase they haven't been able to take their people on the journey.
									Time and time again I have seen in change both challenges and opportunities.

									<p>Problem-solving is at the heart of everything I do. I take complex, messy ideas, systems, technologies,
							                or situations and find ways to simplify and clarify. By breaking challenges down into manageable parts, I
							                uncover the best approaches to move forward effectively and with purpose.</br>
							                Throughout these experiences, I’ve gained a deep understanding of how people navigate change and
							                uncertainty—the fears, motivations, and strengths that come into play during times of transition. </br>
							                This insight enables me to build trust quickly, foster collaboration, and guide individuals and teams toward meaningful outcomes. </br>
							                Today, as a coach and mentor, I help clients embrace change and unlock their potential. I’m passionate
							                about empowering others to see opportunities in uncertainty, navigate transitions with confidence, and align
							                their goals with their values. Whether it’s navigating external changes or creating internal transformation,
							                I’m here to guide you through the process and help you achieve lasting growth.</p>
