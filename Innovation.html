<h2>Executive Coaching</h2>
<p>For Managers and Senior Leaders</p>

<p>Change is inevitable—sometimes we choose it, sometimes it’s thrust upon us. Whether you're
										at a career crossroads, striving for personal growth, or feeling stuck in uncertainty,
										navigating change alone can feel overwhelming. The fear of making the wrong move,
										self-doubt, and unclear next steps can keep you spinning in place.
									But what if change wasn’t something to fear—but an opportunity to redefine what’s possible?<br/></p>
<h3>How I Can Help</h3>
<p>Leadership coaching is about unlocking clarity, confidence, and action. I help you make sense of complex
										situations, break down roadblocks, and move forward with purpose. My approach isn’t about
										giving you the answers—it’s about helping you discover them for yourself. Through structured
										conversations, insightful questioning, and practical tools, I guide you toward real, tangible progress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How I Work</h3>
<p>My coaching style is designed to be:
									<ul>
<li><strong>Conversational and Collaborative</strong> - It’s a partnership where we explore your challenges and aspirations together.</li>
<li><strong>Structured Yet Flexible</strong> - A clear process with room to adapt based on your evolving needs</li>
<li><strong>Confidential and Supportive</strong> - A safe space to reflect, plan, and take action without
							                    fear of judgement</li>
<li><strong>Results Oriented</strong> - We work together toward tangible outcomes that make a real difference
							                    in your life and work</li>
<li><strong>Unique to You</strong> - Our time is dedicated exclusively to creating space for you to think</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>At the core of my coaching is problem-solving—I help untangle complex, messy situations, distill them into clear next steps,
										and provide a practical path forward.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> What to Expect</h3>
<p>A typical executive coaching program consists of 6 session each lasting 60 or 90 minutes, delivered
										virtually or in person.<br/>
									Committing to a programme of  sessions provides the momentum to:
									<ul>
<li>Gain clarity on your goals (Session 1)</li>
<li>Identify obstacles and patterns</li>
<li>Develop strategies to move forward with confidence</li>
<li>Build accountability to sustain your progress</li>
<li>Reflect upon your journey (Session 6)</li>
</ul>
									At the end of our time together, we’ll review progress and decide whether additional coaching would support your long-term growth.

<h2>Coaching &amp; Mentoring for Innovation Leaders</h2>
<p>Support for those building the future inside complex organisations</p>
</header>
<div>
<p><strong>This is about delivery.</strong><br/>
      In innovation roles, your credibility depends on what you can make happen — not just how clever the idea is. I focus relentlessly on helping you deliver outcomes that add real value to someone in the business. That means ensuring your work is visible, aligned to strategy, and grounded in what matters. No vanity projects. No wasted motion. Just traction, trust, and tangible results.</p>
<h3>Where I Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Navigating Complex Stakeholders</strong> – Build alignment across the business with execs, peers, and delivery teams. I’ll help you map the politics, influence without authority, and bring clarity where there's confusion or resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Crafting and Communicating a Vision</strong> – Translate early-stage ideas into a narrative that secures buy-in and aligns teams.</li>
<li><strong>Choosing the Right Frameworks and Tools</strong> – From lean startup to three horizons, we’ll find and apply what actually works in your context.</li>
<li><strong>Partnering with Startups and External Innovators</strong> – Avoid innovation theatre. I’ll support you in finding the right partners, setting terms, and creating genuine value.</li>
<li><strong>Budgeting, Finance, and Proving ROI</strong> – Scope realistically, prioritise effectively, and track what matters. Make every pound count.</li>
<li><strong>Sustaining Credibility, Motivation &amp; Momentum</strong> – Stay energised, influential, and credible through long innovation cycles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You’ll Get</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coaching &amp; Mentoring</strong> – One-to-one sessions focused on what matters to you. A mix of space to reflect and actionable guidance based on lived experience.</li>
<li><strong>Frameworks, Tools &amp; Approaches</strong> – Access to proven models, templates and tools — and support in applying them effectively to your work.</li>
<li><strong>Workshops &amp; Brainstorms</strong> – Optional add-on sessions to align teams, generate ideas, or move complex workstreams forward. Virtual or in-person.</li>
<li><strong>Project Support</strong> – Hands-on help for high-stakes delivery work, including document review and strategic advisory. Charged separately.</li>
<li><strong>Network Building &amp; Introductions</strong> – Connections to relevant startups, agencies, developers, and peers to help accelerate progress.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Access &amp; Support</strong> – Email and phone support within office hours, with a 48-hour SLA, so you’re never left without backup.</li>
