<h2>Coaching &amp; Mentoring for Innovation Leaders</h2>
<p>Support for those building the future inside complex organisations</p>
</header>
<div>
<section>


  <p>I spent over a decade leading innovation teams inside large, complex organisations — and I’ve lived every high and low that comes with the role.</p>

  <p>Innovation jobs are often romanticised, but the truth is more complicated:<br>
  <strong>High expectations. Vague mandates. Tight budgets. Political landmines. And a workforce that can be sceptical, territorial, or just tired of change.</strong></p>

  <p>It’s a tough, high-stakes, and often lonely job — but when it works, it’s one of the most meaningful and energising careers you can have.</p>

  <p>I’ve launched platforms, killed ideas that were too early, steered impossible stakeholder groups, fought for budget, and delivered real results in environments that didn’t always want to change. Along the way, I built up a battle-tested toolkit of models, strategies, and insights — drawn from theory, sharpened by experience, and shaped by what actually works in the wild.</p>

  <p>Now I help other innovation leaders <strong>go faster, stay focused, and make a bigger impact</strong> — without burning out, selling out, or giving up.</p>

  <h3>This Is About Delivery</h3>
  <p>In innovation roles, your credibility lives and dies by one thing:<br>
  <strong>What can you make happen?</strong></p>

  <p>That’s where I come in. I focus relentlessly on traction, visibility, and outcomes. That means helping you deliver work that is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Grounded in what matters</li>
    <li>Aligned to business strategy</li>
    <li>Visible to the right people</li>
    <li>Measured in real terms</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>No vanity projects. No wasted effort. Just clarity, momentum, and trust.</strong></p>
