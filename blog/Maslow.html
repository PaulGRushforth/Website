            <p>You’ve probably come across Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs — the pyramid diagram that shows how our most basic human needs must be met before
              we can reach our full potential. Despite being over 70 years old, Maslow’s theory is more relevant than ever — especially in today’s workplaces, industries, and careers.</p>
              <p>In this post, I’ll walk through each stage of Maslow’s Hierarchy — reimagined for the modern workplace — and explore what leaders and coaches can do at every
              level to support meaningful growth, connection, and performance.</p>
          <h3>Here’s a quick refresher</h3>
             <p>Maslow suggested that the aim of every human being was "self-actualization": being the very best you can be. This was the very top of the pyramid.
              In order to get there, however, you must ascend through all the other levels, each of which builds on the previous one.
              Put simply, at the very base level, if you don’t have food, shelter, and somewhere to sleep — you’re not going to last long. </p>
              <p>nce you have those, you need a job, a home, financial security, and to be in a physically safe environment — then you can start to do the real work.
              We are social animals; we need positive relationships in our lives to help us not only survive, but thrive. That comes next: love and belonging.
              With all these in place, we start to feel good, capable, recognised, in control, and able to achieve. And many do.</p>
              <p>Once we get to this stage, we are ready to do the things we need to do to be the best we can be. This is the Holy Grail: self-actualisation.
              But here’s the thing: many organisations don’t realise how far down the pyramid some of their people really are — especially in times of change.</p>
              <p>To help us understand why, let’s have a look at these levels through the lens of 2025.</p>
             <h3>Physiological Needs: The Overlooked Foundation</h3>
              I almost skipped this section. I nearly assumed, like many leaders do, that physiological needs weren’t worth discussing in a modern, salaried workplace. But that’s exactly the trap.
              A steady income doesn’t guarantee rest, nutrition, or even shelter. In 2025, many full-time employees are sleep-deprived, undernourished, battling the effects of poor air quality, or living with the financial stress of rising rent and unstable housing.
              The bottom of Maslow’s pyramid isn’t just for crisis zones — it’s very much alive in our offices, Zoom calls, and staff rooms.
              So ask yourself: When was the last time you checked in — really checked in — to understand whether your team’s most basic human needs are being met?
              Do your staff eat well? Get regular exercise? Do they have a space at home where they can work? What else is going on in their life that could be preventing these basic needs from being met? How are they doing financially?
              You could make the argument that this is not your responsibility, or none of your business, but given that everything else is based on this foundational layer, don’t you have a duty to make sure your team is set up for success?
              Redefining Safety in the Modern Workplace
              In the modern workplace there are many aspects that impact one’s feeling of safety and security:
              How secure is my role?


How clearly defined is my role and do I understand how to undertake it?


Does my workplace feel toxic? Politically charged? Biased?


How stable is my industry and my organisation’s position within it?


We live in a world where almost every sector is dealing with volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity — the classic VUCA environment. It’s no wonder so many employees feel a deep sense of instability.
People might appear fine on the surface, but underneath they’re asking: Am I okay? Will I still have a job in six months? Will I be supported if my role changes, or even disappears?
This is where leadership matters most.
If you’re in a leadership role, ask yourself:
What are you as a leader doing to reduce ambiguity and uncertainty?


Are you clearly communicating change, or assuming people will catch up?


Are you actively tackling toxic behaviours and confusion — or letting them quietly fester?


Safety is foundational. Without it, no amount of vision, messaging, or motivation will land.
Building Belonging Without Proximity
The pandemic didn’t just change where we work, it reshaped how we connect.
Today’s "normal" is a geographically dispersed, digitally dependent workforce. But while the rules have shifted, our human need for connection hasn’t.
We all know the saying "culture eats strategy for breakfast", but how do you build a culture if your team is rarely in the same office? What does it even mean to be a part of a team in 2025?
We still believe in trust, collaboration, and belonging — but the structures that once supported those beliefs have changed. Proximity used to do a lot of the heavy lifting. Now, leaders have to be intentional about how connection happens — or doesn’t.
Belonging matters because it shapes identity. It grounds people in purpose. When those connections are missing or weak, performance and engagement suffer.
These challenges aren’t just about geography. They’re also generational: Gen Z employees entering the workforce in a hybrid world often value flexibility and digital-first interaction. Meanwhile, Gen X leaders may be relying on outdated rituals — like post-work drinks or informal chats — that no longer happen.
That’s not wrong. But it’s not enough.
So ask yourself:
What does belonging feel like in your organisation today?


How does your culture show up across time zones, screens, and silos?


Are you creating shared experiences — or just shared calendars?


Meaningful Recognition in a Fast-Moving World
Recognition is key to our sense of self-worth, whether we get it from others or provide it to ourselves.
In the modern workplace, meaningful recognition comes in many forms: autonomy, trust, opportunity for growth, and more. Positive and negative recognition shapes our view of not only our value to the organisation, but our value as a person. In today’s fast-paced environments, leaders must consider what recognition they are providing and how.
This isn’t about celebrating every small success. It’s about the right recognition, delivered in the right way, at the right time. It’s about understanding what forms of recognition each individual receives best, and the impact it can have on their ability to grow.
But recognition also needs to come from within. Employees (and leaders!) must develop the capability to reflect on their successes and failures and react accordingly.
The ability to provide self-recognition is a key capability that supports development and growth. This isn’t a replacement for external recognition, but an important partner to it. Helping your team understand and develop their own internal recognition systems is one of the most impactful things you can do as a leader.
Take some time to consider the different ways in which you provide your team with recognition, both positive and negative:
What patterns emerge?


What are your assumptions regarding the frequency and types of recognition your team needs?


How can you test these assumptions?


Which recognition methods have the biggest impact?


Do your team members recognise themselves? Each other?


Why Promotion Isn’t the Peak
It’s easy to assume that the ambition of every employee is to get a promotion, a pay rise, more responsibilities. But these things do not necessarily represent self-actualisation — especially not in the modern world. Self-actualisation encompasses so much more for workers today.
Having worked closely with both creative and technical talent of exceptional levels, I’ve seen what happens when employees are, by design, promoted away from their passion.
In rewarding high performers with promotions, we often strip away the very work that energised them in the first place. These tasks are replaced by managerial responsibilities, process-heavy overheads, and myriad other activities that don’t necessarily allow them to feel that they are reaching their full potential as a person.
A huge part of an employee’s "self" might be grounded in their family life, their hobbies and interests, or other non-career aspirations. Perhaps helping them achieve fulfilment and self-actualisation means recognising that these external ambitions need supporting just as much as the internal (career) ones. You’ll be helping them create a reason to stay, rather than a reason to leave.
So instead of assuming that the only thing employees crave is a promotion, why not engage in a conversation about where they really draw their energy from, what their real aspirations and goals are, and align your actions with these? In coaching, we look at the whole person. I would advise the same approach for leaders of all levels.
What might represent fulfilment to your team members?


What alternatives to promotions and salary incentives could you propose?


How might a promotion negatively impact fulfilment?


What does self-actualisation look like for the "whole self" of your team members?


Coaching & Leadership Through a Maslow Lens
Using Maslow as part of a coaching approach can help employees understand where they are on the pyramid — and what might be holding them back. It also helps leaders tailor their support more effectively.
Expecting people to operate at a higher level than they're currently at is a risky strategy. And it happens more often than we think — especially when we don’t take the time to ask, listen, and observe. That’s why honest, sometimes direct, conversations matter.
Throughout this article, I’ve offered questions and prompts to help you uncover where your team members are right now — and how you might support them in moving upward.
Final Thoughts: From Theory to Leadership Practice
Maslow’s framework is more than a theory — it’s a practical, powerful lens for leadership, coaching, and team development. By recognising where people are on the pyramid, you can reduce friction, unlock potential, and build trust that lasts.
You don’t need to be a psychologist to use this. Just a leader who listens, pays attention, and responds with empathy and clarity.
If you’d like help using Maslow’s model to improve performance, engagement, or communication in your team, I’d love to explore it with you.
