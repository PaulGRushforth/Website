  <h1>Maslow’s Hierarchy Reimagined for the Modern Workplace</h1>
  <p>You’ve probably come across Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs — the pyramid diagram that shows how our most basic human needs must be met before we can reach our full potential. Despite being over 70 years old, Maslow’s theory is more relevant than ever — especially in today’s workplaces, industries, and careers.</p>

  <p>In this post, I’ll walk through each stage of Maslow’s Hierarchy — reimagined for the modern workplace — and explore what leaders and coaches can do at every level to support meaningful growth, connection, and performance.</p>

  <h2>Here’s a quick refresher</h2>
  <p>Maslow suggested that the aim of every human being was <strong>"self-actualization"</strong>: being the very best you can be. This was the very top of the pyramid. In order to get there, however, you must ascend through all the other levels, each of which builds on the previous one.</p>

  <p><img src="path/to/maslow-pyramid.jpg" alt="Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Pyramid" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p>

  <p>Put simply, at the very base level, if you don’t have food, shelter, and somewhere to sleep — you’re not going to last long.</p>

  <p>Once you have those, you need a job, a home, financial security, and to be in a physically safe environment — then you can start to do the real work.</p>

  <p>We are social animals; we need positive relationships in our lives to help us not only survive, but thrive. That comes next: love and belonging.</p>

  <p>With all these in place, we start to feel good, capable, recognised, in control, and able to achieve. And many do.</p>

  <p>Once we get to this stage, we are ready to do the things we need to do to be the best we can be. This is the Holy Grail: self-actualisation.</p>

  <p>But here’s the thing: many organisations don’t realise how far down the pyramid some of their people really are — especially in times of change.</p>

  <p>To help us understand why, let’s have a look at a couple of these levels through the lens of 2025.</p>

  <h2>Physiological Needs: The Overlooked Foundation</h2>
  <p>I almost skipped this section. I nearly assumed, like many leaders do, that physiological needs weren’t worth discussing in a modern, salaried workplace. But that’s exactly the trap.</p>

  <p>A steady income doesn’t guarantee rest, nutrition, or even shelter. In 2025, many full-time employees are sleep-deprived, undernourished, battling the effects of poor air quality, or living with the financial stress of rising rent and unstable housing.</p>

  <p>The bottom of Maslow’s pyramid isn’t just for crisis zones — it’s very much alive in our offices, Zoom calls, and staff rooms.</p>

  <p><strong>So ask yourself:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>When was the last time you checked in — really checked in — to understand whether your team’s most basic human needs are being met?</li>
    <li>Do your staff eat well? Get regular exercise?</li>
    <li>Do they have a space at home where they can work?</li>
    <li>What else is going on in their life that could be preventing these basic needs from being met?</li>
    <li>How are they doing financially?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You could make the argument that this is not your responsibility, or none of your business, but given that everything else is based on this foundational layer, don’t you have a duty to make sure your team is set up for success?</p>

  <h2>Redefining Safety in the Modern Workplace</h2>
  <p>In the modern workplace there are many aspects that impact one’s feeling of safety and security:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How secure is my role?</li>
    <li>How clearly defined is my role and do I understand how to undertake it?</li>
    <li>Does my workplace feel toxic? Politically charged? Biased?</li>
    <li>How stable is my industry and my organisation’s position within it?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We live in a world where almost every sector is dealing with volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity — the classic VUCA environment. It’s no wonder so many employees feel a deep sense of instability.</p>

  <p>People might appear fine on the surface, but underneath
