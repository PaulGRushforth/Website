									<blockquote>“Paul is fantastic at fostering an open and safe environment that always made
									me feel like I was able to share my thoughts in confidence. Every session felt
									like it was structured around me and what I wanted to achieve rather than a ‘paint by numbers’
									approach that I have experienced with other coaches/mentors. Working with Paul
									has enabled me to be calmer and more methodical in my approach to complex tasks,
									I feel like my ability to communicate and get buy in from senior stakeholders within
									my business has vastly improved in the past 12 months and there is no doubt in my
									mind that is due to my work with Paul.<br>
									I would recommend Paul to anyone who is struggling with communicating complex projects
									or ideas to senior stakeholders or is looking for support with exploring how to effectively
									mange and deliver cross departmental projects.”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“Paul is an excellent coach; with his support, knowledge and reflective
									skills I was able to work through the pros and cons of whether to transition from one
									senior post to another. I went on to achieve this change smoothly whilst being
									mindful of my own boundaries. He was not afraid to appropriately challenge me and
									was a wealth of knowledge on various coaching techniques and useful exercises,
									which helped to draw out and explore my hopes and fears.”</blockquote>
									<p><strong> Dr A Fry, GP Partner & Director of Greener Practice</br> January 2025</Strong></p>
