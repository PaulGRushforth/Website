									<p><strong> Andrew, Creative Director</br>April 2025</Strong></p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>
										<span class="testimonial-snippet">“I started working with Paul a few months ago.
										His brief from me was to help me put a few career ideas into an order and help me figure out what next.
										I wanted to be prepared and have a plan in place that I could activate whenever needed.</p>
										<p>We started exploring ideas and a number of directions.
										Each week Paul would ask probing questions, challenge me and help me think through my ideas, ambitions and skills.
										Over a few weeks we filtered down some of the ideas,  explored the practicalities and thoroughly stress tested each option.</p>
									</span>
										<span class="testimonial-full" style="display: none;">
										<p>It’s been a thoroughly enjoyable process and I have valued Pauls input in helping me put all these thoughts into and order
										and ultimately hatch a deliverable plan.  His mentorship has helped me regain my confidence and I now feel prepared
										for the next chapter in my career and life.</p>
										<p>I would recommend Paul as a coach and mentor.</p>
										<p>I had never done anything like this before but feel it has been a hugely beneficial experience for me. ”</p></blockquote>

									<p><strong> Cameron, Technology Sales Manager</br>February 2025</Strong></p>
									<blockquote>“Paul is fantastic at fostering an open and safe environment that always made
									me feel like I was able to share my thoughts in confidence. Every session felt
									like it was structured around me and what I wanted to achieve rather than a ‘paint by numbers’
									approach that I have experienced with other coaches/mentors. Working with Paul
									has enabled me to be calmer and more methodical in my approach to complex tasks,
									I feel like my ability to communicate and get buy in from senior stakeholders within
									my business has vastly improved in the past 12 months and there is no doubt in my
									mind that is due to my work with Paul.<br>
									I would recommend Paul to anyone who is struggling with communicating complex projects
									or ideas to senior stakeholders or is looking for support with exploring how to effectively
									mange and deliver cross departmental projects.”</blockquote>

									<p><strong> Dr A Fry, GP Partner & Director of Greener Practice</br> January 2025</Strong></p>
									<blockquote>“Paul is an excellent coach; with his support, knowledge and reflective
									skills I was able to work through the pros and cons of whether to transition from one
									senior post to another. I went on to achieve this change smoothly whilst being
									mindful of my own boundaries. He was not afraid to appropriately challenge me and
									was a wealth of knowledge on various coaching techniques and useful exercises,
									which helped to draw out and explore my hopes and fears.”</blockquote>
