<h2>Coaching &amp; Mentoring for Innovation Leaders</h2>
<p>Support for those building the future inside complex organisations</p>
</header>
<div>
<p>I spent over a decade leading innovation teams inside large, complex organisations — and I’ve lived every high and low that comes with the job. 
	Innovation roles are often romanticised, but most of the clichés are true: high expectations, vague mandates, tight budgets, political landmines,
	and a workforce that can be sceptical, jealous, or openly resistant to change.</p>

<p>It’s a tough and often lonely place to be. But it’s also one of the most meaningful and exciting jobs out there — if you’re properly supported.</p>

<p>I didn’t just learn innovation from books (though I’ve read plenty). I’ve lived it. I’ve launched new platforms, navigated impossible stakeholder groups,
	scrapped ideas that were too early, fought for budget, and learned how to deliver value in real, measurable ways. Along the way, I’ve built a toolkit
	of models, frameworks, communication strategies, stakeholder tactics, and proven approaches — and now I want to share that with others in this role.</p>

<p>This offer combines coaching and mentoring to help innovation leaders thrive wherever they are in their journey.</p>	
<h4>This is about delivery.</h4>
      In innovation roles, your credibility depends on what you can make happen — not just how clever the idea is. I focus relentlessly on helping you deliver
	outcomes that add real value to someone in the business. That means ensuring your work is visible, aligned to strategy, and grounded in what matters.
	No vanity projects. No wasted motion. Just traction, trust, and tangible results.</p>
